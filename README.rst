map2loop Package
================

map2loop is a map deconstruction library to provide inputs to Loop ([Loop3d.org](https://loop3d.org/)). 
The development of map2loop is lead by **Mark Jessell** at The University of Western Australia. **Yohan de Rose** at Monash University is now making it better. Standalone map2model cpp code from Vitaliy provides fault/fault and fault/strat relationships.   

1. What it does:
################

-  Combines information extracted from vector geology maps in various forms to support 3D geological modelling. 

Outputs are simple csv files that should be readable by any 3D modelling system (I think), but specific examples are provided for    

- https://github.com/Loop3D/LoopStructural LoopStructural,    
- https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy gempy and   
- https://github.com/cgre-aachen/pynoddy noddy.   
   
Loop is led by Laurent Ailleres (Monash University) with a team of Work Package leaders from:
 * Monash University: Roy Thomson, Lachlan Grose and Robin Armit
 * University of Western Australia: Mark Jessell, Jeremie Giraud, Mark Lindsay and Guillaume Pirot
 * Geological Survey of Canada: Boyan Brodaric and Eric de Kemp

- This is very much a proof of concept code that is unlikely to work first time with anything but the example dataset provided, but if you would like to try it with your own data please feel free to contact me at mark.jessell@uwa.edu.au to discuss your plans.  
- The fastest install path (thanks to Yohan de Rose) is via docker, go to development version at which provides both map2loop and LoopStructural:
       
  http://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop-2    
   
- otherwise follow these instructions:

2. Installation
###############

You will need some flavour of conda (a python package manager, https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html, as well as Python ≥ 3.6

**2.1 Run**

To just use map2loop, issue the following
::

  conda install -c conda-forge -c loop3d map2loop -y


**2.2 Development**

If you want to tinker yourself/contribute, clone the source code with

::

  git clone https://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop-2.git

Or get the source + example notebooks with

::

  git clone https://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop-2.git
  git clone --single-branch --branch yohan https://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop2-notebooks

Navigate into map2loop-2, and issue the following to install map2loop and its dependencies. _Note_: The 'develop' flag makes your source changes take effect on saving, so you only need to run this once

::
  conda install -c loop3d --file dependencies.txt
  python setup.py install

**2.3 Building with Docker**

Fair warning, we recommend conda to almost everyone. With great software development power comes great environment setup inconvenience. You'll need to download and install the [docker containerisation software](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and the docker and docker-compose CLI.

Development 

a. Clone this repo and navigate inside as per above
b. Run the following and click on the Jupyter server forwarded link to access and edit the notebooks

::

  docker-compose up --build

c. To hop into a bash shell in a running container, open a terminal and issue

::

  bash
  docker ps
   

   Find the container name or ID and then run

::

  bash
  docker exec -it <container_NAMEorID> bash
  # Probably -> docker exec -it  map2loop-2_dev_1 bash

**2.4 Usage**

Our notebooks at https://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop2-notebooks cover use cases in more detail, but here is an example of processing Loop's South Australia remote geospatial data in just 20 lines of Python.

First, lets import map2loop and define a bounding box. You can use GIS software to find one or use [Loop's Graphical User Interface](https://loop3d.github.io/downloads.html) for the best experience and complete toolset. Remember what projection your coordinates are in!

**2.5 Known Issues and FAQs**

- Developing with docker on Windows means you won't have GPU passthrough and can’t use a discrete graphics card in the container even if you have one.
- If Jupyter links require a token or password, it may mean port 8888 is already in use. To fix, either make docker map to another port on the host ie -p 8889:8888 or stop any other instances on 8888.
- Sometimes the submodules misbehave. Ensure you specify the recurse-submodules flag with an 's' as opposed to recurse-submodule, and double-check your .git directory is clean, see https://github.com/Loop3D/map2loop-2/issues/41

4. Using *map2loop* with your own or standard datasets
######################################################

In order to deconstruct a map with *map2loop*, we need to undertake the following steps:
  a. Ensure that we have sufficient correctly formatted data, with sufficient information to allow the calculations to work. 

  b. Once we have these data, we then need to define a set of parameters that inform *map2loop* about this data, and the details of the calculations to undertaken. Use the notebook **Utility 1 - Config file generator.ipynb** to make this slightly less painful.

  c. Finally, once we have the data and *map2loop* control parameters sorted, we are ready to create a small python script to test the system.
   
5. Minimum *map2loop* data requirements:  
########################################

**5.1 Vector Geospatial File Data Formats:**

'DXF': 'raw', 'CSV': 'raw', 'OpenFileGDB': 'r', 'ESRIJSON': 'r', 'ESRI Shapefile': 'raw', 'GeoJSON': 'rw', 'GeoJSONSeq': 'rw', 'GPKG': 'rw', 'GML': 'raw',  'MapInfo File': 'raw'

r=read, a=append, w=write

- geology polygons with stratigraphic code and rock type info (required)
  
- fault polylines (required)

- bed dips as points in dip, dip direction (required)

- mineral deposit layer (optional)

- fold axial trace layer (optional)
  
**5.2 Geology Polygons (or Multipolygons):**

- no gaps or overlaps between polygons, nodes from neighbouring polygons coincide (we have code to fix errors when the mismatch is smaller than the minimum node spacing).

- Stratigraphic Coherency:
  - Ideally the map should consist of polygons which all have the same stratigraphic heirarchical level, e.g. all formations, all groups, all members etc. This is often not the case, and it makes unravelling the stratigraphy more complex, as the parent and child may appear in the same map, so the age sorting needed to build the model becomes ambiguous. National or state-level stratigraphies, and even stratigraphies described on map sheet legends are by definition simplifications of the the local system extracted by *map2loop*. *map2loop* uses the local stratigraphy first and then uses the regional stratigraphy (if available) as a guide to reduce the uncertainty.
  
- Attributes with (data type) and {code} (see section 2.2):
    - Fine Scale Stratigraphic coding, e.g. formation name (str) {'c'}
    - Coarser Scale stratigraphic coding, such as its parent, e.g. group (str) {'g'}
    - Alternate Coarser Scale stratigraphic coding, e.g. group (str) {'g2'}
    - Relative or absolute maximum age of Fine Scale Stratigraphic Code (float) {'max'}
    - Relative or absolute minimum age of Fine Scale Stratigraphic Code (float) {'min'}
    - Litho code to help determine if rock is intrusive (str) {'ds'}
    - Litho Code to help detemrine if this is a sill-like body (str) {'sill'}
    - Unique ID of polygon (str) {'o'}

**5.3 Fault Polylines:**

- single polyline per fault (no multipolylines)
- nodes on faulted boundaries coincident with geology polygon nodes

- Attributes:
    - Text that identifies polyline as a fault (str) {'fault'}
    - Dip of fault (str or float) {'fdip'}
    - Dip Direction of Fault (str or float) {'fdipdir'}

**5.4 Bedding Points:**

- single points (no multipoints)

Attributes:
  - Dip (float) {'d'}
  - Dip Direction or Strike (float) {'dd'}
  - Code to show what convention is used: Strike RHR, or DD at the moment (str) {'otype'}
  - Code to show what type of foliation: Bedding, S1 etc. (str) {'sf'}
  - Code to say this unit is overturned (str) {'bo'}

**5.5 Mineral Deposits: (Optional)**

- single points (no multipoints)

Attributes:
  - Site Code (str) {'msc'}
  - Name of deposit (str) {'msn'}
  - Type of feature: open pit, occurence, abandoned etc., (str) {'mst'}
  - Code to show what main commodity: Fe, Iron, etc. (str) {'mtc'}
  - Code to show what main commodity class: Industrial, Metal, etc. (str) {'mcom'}
  
**5.6 Fold Axial Trace Polylines: (Optional)**

- single polyline per trace (no multipolylines)

Attributes:
  - Text that identifies polyline as a fold axial trace (str) {'feature'}
  - Code that defines fold as syncline (str) {'syn'}


6) Defining *map2loop* parameters:
##################################

There are four types of parameters we need to define in order to use *map2loop*:
  - **a) The paths or URLs** that tell *map2loop* where the information layers (GIS files or online sources) are stored. These are passed to the *map2loop* update_config() method.
  - **b) The names of fields and some text flags** that tell *map2loop* where specific information can be retrieved from these layers. These are stored in an hjson format text file the path of which is passed to the *map2loop* Project() method.
  - **c) A data output path, bounding box and Coordinate Reference System** information to define the extent of the model and where to put it. This is passed to the *map2loop* update_config() method
  - **d) Parameters that control the specific functioning** of *map2loop*: what to calculate, what decimation factors to apply to the augmented data outputs, what resolution interpolations to use etc. These is passed to the map2looop project.run() method.


**6.1 paths**

These is passed to the *map2loop* Project() method.

Examples:
   
**Remote WFS layers: See Example 1 Notebook**
::

  proj=Project(geology_file = 'http://geo.loop-gis.org/geoserver/loop/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeName=loop:geol_500k&bbox={}&srs=EPSG:28350',
              fault_file='http:// etc.',
              structure_file='http:// etc.',
              mindep_file='http:// etc.,
              metadata="http://anyurl.org/mydata.hjson', 
              remote=True)

where remote=True signifies that WFS-served data will be accessed.
   
**Standard Australia State Geological Surveys datasets, we have predefined the paths for all data and the following code is sufficient: See Example 2 Notebook**

where remote=False signifies that local GIS files will be accessed. Paths can be relative or absolute, or even a URL, however for URLs, the components of the shapefile or TAB file have to be zipped up.

**6.2 Layer field codes:**

You will need to create or modify an *hjson* format file that provides the names of fields and some text flags that tell *map2loop* where and what specific information can be retrieved from these layers. These are stored in an hjson format text file the path of which is passed to the *map2loop* Project() method. The easiest way to get started is to use a jupyter notebook allows you to reduce errors by providing a primitive GUI for creating an *hjson* config file and associated python script, named: **Utility 1 - Config file generator.ipynb**. Alternatively if you are brave you can edit the values to the right of the colon in each row of an existing *hjson* file. For example to specify that the field in the geospatial layer that contains bedding dip information is called **MYDIP**, replace the appropriate code in the *hjson* file below with:

 "d":"MYDIP",

Some verification is carried out by *map2loop* to ensure the required parameters have been defined. In the following section *field* refers to a field name in a geospatial layer; *text* refers to some text in the contents of a field for a specific geometric object.  You shouldn't use the same field for different codes as this may cause problems.
